    <p>MatPat was born in Medina, Ohio as an only child and grew to love two arts: video games and theater. He graduated valedictorian in high school and went to Duke University, where he met Stephanie in a game programming class. MatPat had some decent success as a stage actor but quit as he and Stephanie were financially struggling and had no luck getting a new job. During this time, MatPat watched an episode of Extra Credits about tangential learning, which inspired him to start Game Theory originally as a means of adding something new to his resume. Game Theory slowly started building a fanbase after getting featured on several websites, such as Reviewtopia and ScrewAttack! and started incorporating elements from MatPat's directing experience and fan submissions (such as a logo and SpellingPhailer's intro music). Its success helped MatPat with his career and opening new job prospects.</p>
